 0.4.4 ()

This is a stability release. The number of new supported Flash features
is limited.
- add initial support for some tags from Flash 8 (in particular 
  DefineShape4 and PlaceObject3)
- audio and video can now be decoded with GStreamer
- add new API in the form of libswfdec-gtk for people that want to 
  include Swfdec in their applications
- improve the JPEG decoding code (less crashy, more JPEGs decoded)
- throw zzuf (http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/) at Swfdec and fix exposed
  issues
- various fixes that make writing bindings simpler
- lots of bugs fixed, including: 10551, 10629

 0.4.3 ("Your tube")

This release can play Youtube video. While this alone is enough for a 
release, this was needed to make it possible:
- add lots of new features to the script interpreter, in particular 
  support for inheritance and the Object.registerClass function.
- rework the streaming and implement the NetStream, NetConnection and
  XML script objects partially
- support passing variables to movies
- improvements to the JPEG decoder
- improvements to the debugging framework and the debugger
- support some more Flash 8 tags (in particular DefineFont3)

 0.4.2 ("Two completely different numbers")

The main change for this release is changing script execution from 
compiling to SpiderMonkey bytecode to executiong it manually. This made
it far easier and a lot more stable to run scripts. Other changes:
- Implement color transformations on images.
- Support some more ActionScript codes.
- Added swfdec_loader_get_filename() function to exported API.
- Allow compiling tests and tools without ALSA support
- Lots of bugfixes.
- Lots of new tests and debugging tools.

 0.4.1 ("Dragostea din tei")

This release introduces video features. Quite a bit of internal 
restructuring was necessary to achieve this. The API has been changed 
from 0.4.0. Changes:
- swfdec_player_iterate has been replaced by swfdec_player_advance
- some functions (like swfdec_player_set_audio_advance) have been 
  completely removed. The same effect can be achieved by using 
  swfdec_player_advance.
- Add support for video playback. This does not include scripting 
  video.
- Add native FLV support to swfdec.
- Fix the caching layer. So SWF files with lots of images no longer 
  crash swfdec.
- Lots of bugfixes.

 0.4.0 ("festivally plump")

This is the result of 3 months of refactoring, testing stuff and 
generally playing around with swfdec. I'll try to list the big 
changes:
- rip out support for outdated libart
- rip out included glib
- rework the object system to have a lot more objects
- split objects into "live" (SwfdecMovie, SwfdfecAudio), "static"
  (SwfdecCharacter) and Javascript (JSObjects)
- compile Flash Actionscript codes into SpiderMonkey bytecode
- add testsuite
- reverse engineer script execution order
- reverse engineer seeking in sprite movies
- implement lots of other Actionscript functions
- documentation for public API
- removal of all plugins (the Mozilla plugin exists as a seperate 
  package now)
- new small test application (not installed)
- slightly bigger script debugging application (not installed)

 0.3.6 ("5.11d")

This is less of a release and more of a "toss a bunch of code into
the air".  You're not going to like this release, really.  So don't
bother compiling it.  Don't even bother downloading it.  It really
just differently buggy than the last release.  Certain parts may
feel more solid, like the mozilla plugin, but the entire experience
will probably just be slower and less featureful.  I already know
there are problems, don't bother reporting them, since it will
simply remind me of how crappy this release is.  The only redeeming
factor of this release is that it doesn't crash.  Ever.  Well,
except for the bugs.  Backtraces and media files welcome.  You
could even use the handy new pop-up menu in the Mozilla plugin to
report a bug, except that I don't have the website backend running
yet.
