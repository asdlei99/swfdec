 0.4.0 ("festivally plump")

This is the result of 3 months of refactoring, testing stuff and 
generally playing around with swfdec. I'll try to list the big 
changes:
- rip out support for outdated libart
- rip out included glib
- rework the object system to have a lot more objects
- split objects into "live" (SwfdecMovie, SwfdfecAudio), "static"
  (SwfdecCharacter) and Javascript (JSObjects)
- compile Flash Actionscript codes into SpiderMonkey bytecode
- add testsuite
- reverse engineer script execution order
- reverse engineer seeking in sprite movies
- implement lots of other Actionscript functions
- documentation for public API
- removal of all plugins (the Mozilla plugin exists as a seperate 
  package now)
- new small test application (not installed)
- slightly bigger script debugging application (not installed)

 0.3.6 ("5.11d")

This is less of a release and more of a "toss a bunch of code into
the air".  You're not going to like this release, really.  So don't
bother compiling it.  Don't even bother downloading it.  It really
just differently buggy than the last release.  Certain parts may
feel more solid, like the mozilla plugin, but the entire experience
will probably just be slower and less featureful.  I already know
there are problems, don't bother reporting them, since it will
simply remind me of how crappy this release is.  The only redeeming
factor of this release is that it doesn't crash.  Ever.  Well,
except for the bugs.  Backtraces and media files welcome.  You
could even use the handy new pop-up menu in the Mozilla plugin to
report a bug, except that I don't have the website backend running
yet.
