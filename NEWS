 0.3.6 ("5.11d")

This is less of a release and more of a "toss a bunch of code into
the air".  You're not going to like this release, really.  So don't
bother compiling it.  Don't even bother downloading it.  It really
just differently buggy than the last release.  Certain parts may
feel more solid, like the mozilla plugin, but the entire experience
will probably just be slower and less featureful.  I already know
there are problems, don't bother reporting them, since it will
simply remind me of how crappy this release is.  The only redeeming
factor of this release is that it doesn't crash.  Ever.  Well,
except for the bugs.  Backtraces and media files welcome.  You
could even use the handy new pop-up menu in the Mozilla plugin to
report a bug, except that I don't have the website backend running
yet.
