clean up symbol leakage

plugin: size to window (?) if no embed bounds

lib: global scaling

General problems:

- two areas that share a boundary are not drawn so that the boundary
  is completely opaque

- gradients are not rendered at all

napsterbad.swf: the 'tickets $200' screen shows how the compose flag
  is not rendered correctly.

napsterbad.swf: dollar signs not rendered with transparency because the
  shapes are inverted.

fuyu.swf:  ears/antennae aren't rendered correctly.  May have something
  to do with new styles in the shape definition.

01F1D831d01.swf: many objects not being rendered at all

01F1D831d01.swf: ADPCM sound stream

1FE62EDBd01.swf: some of the shapes are inverted, causing rendering problems

34CC04FAd01.swf: has DefineBitsJPEG2

50F99216d01.swf: sound stream
