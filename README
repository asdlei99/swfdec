Swfdec is a decoder/renderer for Macromedia Flash animations.  The
decoding and rendering engine is provided in a library that can
be used by other applications.  A Mozilla plugin is provided that
uses the library for playing SWF files in a 

Swfdec also contains a GdkPixbuf loader module for SWF files, which
means that GTK+ themes can use SWF files as images.  I have no clue
why someone would want to do this, but it's possible.

Notes:

 - If you install into /usr/local, your browser may have difficulty
   finding the plugin.  This can be solved for mozilla-based
   browsers by adding /usr/local/lib/mozilla/plugins to the
   MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
 
 - Sound output is handled by SDL, so the target device can be
   chosen by setting the SDL_AUDIODRIVER environment variable.


Limitations:

 - A few object types are not handled at all.  They don't appear very
   often, however.

 - SWF files that use Flash versions 5 and 6 are generally heavily
   dependent on ActionScript2 features, which are rather buggy at
   the moment.  The default action is to stop playing if known-buggy
   codepaths are used.  This is a runtime switch, but it's likely
   that only developers would want to change this behavior.
