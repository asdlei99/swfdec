swfdec is a decoder/renderer library for Macromedia Flash animations.
Included is a simple GTK2-based player and an even simpler Mozilla
plugin that allows the player to be embedded into your favorite
browser.  (Note that it's not necessary to have a GTK+-2.0-based
browser.)

This release represents a significant milestone -- I can browse
web sites looking for poorly handled SWF files without getting too
annoyed by it crashing.

However, this is alpha software.  Do not expect it to work for you.


Notes:

 - If you install into /usr/local, you'll need to add
   /usr/local/lib/mozilla/plugins to MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH.  (I think.  I
   generally copy it into ~ds/.mozilla/plugins.)  Also, some versions
   of Mozilla are picky about permissions and symlinks.


Limitations:

 - Two MAJOR features are completely unsupported: action scripts and
   user interaction.  This means that it is not yet possible to use
   swfdec to navigate Flash-heavy web sites.

 - The player is quite limited, doesn't play sound, and doesn't play
   frames at the correct rate.

 - A number of object types are not handled at all.

 - Many features of Flash versions 4, 5, and 6 are not supported or
   parsed.
