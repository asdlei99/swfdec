Swfdec is a decoder/renderer library for Macromedia Flash animations.
Included is a simple GTK2-based player and an even simpler Mozilla
plugin that allows the player to be embedded into your favorite
browser.  (Note that it's not necessary to have a GTK+-2.0-based
browser.)

Swfdec-0.2.1 now contains a GdkPixbuf loader module for SWF files.
I have _no clue_ why anyone would want Flash animations as part of
their GDK theme, but it is now possible.

This is alpha software.  Do not expect it to work for you.


Notes:

 - If you install into /usr/local, you'll need to add
   /usr/local/lib/mozilla/plugins to the MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH
   environment variable.
 
 - Sound output is handled by SDL, so the target device can be
   chosen by setting the SDL_AUDIODRIVER environment variable.


Limitations:

 - Two MAJOR features are completely unsupported: action scripts and
   user interaction.  This means that it is not yet possible to use
   swfdec to navigate Flash-heavy web sites.

 - A few object types are not handled at all.  They don't appear very
   often, however.

 - Flash versions 4, 5, and 6 are generally heavily dependent on
   action scripting features, which are not currently supported.
 
 - It is not possible to determine if a Flash animation has sound or
   not until the sound starts.  Thus, the player always assumes there
   is sound and attempts to aquire the sound device.  This can cause
   problems on pages that have multiple embedded Flash animations.


Dependencies:

  libart_lgpl (>= 2.0)
  libgtk+ (>= 2.0)
  zlib (>= 1.1.4)
